    <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
    <p>This webpage details the user interactions and experiences with a microwave.</p>

    <p>This interface on the microwave is designed to help users reheat different food items. With the interface, users should be able to specify the amount of time they want to heat their food.</p>
    <p>You can use the numbers to quickly set the microwave for that number of minutes (e.g. press 2 for 2 minutes) or press "Cook Time" and enter the amount of time to set the microwave. You can also use the "Cancel/Off" and "Add 30 Seconds" buttons to either end or extend the amount of time.</p>

    <h2>
      User Questions
    </h2>

    <p>These are the questions I prepared:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Does this microwave differ to other microwaves you used in the past? If so, how?</li>
      <li>How easy is it to set the amount of time you want the microwave to be on for?</li>
      <li>Do you know how to stop the microwave? Do you use the “Cancel/Off” button or just open the microwave to stop it?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      User Observations
    </h2>

    <p>Summary of my observations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It's easy to use</li>
      <li>Users mention different ways to stop microwave, both by pulling open microwave and pressing the "Cancel/Off" button</li>
      <li>One user said microwave differs to one used at home</li>
      <li>Some noted how this microwave turns on vent for cooking and it was confusing to turn on vent the first time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Personas
    </h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/manny.PNG" alt="Trulli" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
      <figcaption>Manny is a college student who is familiar with microwaves. He uses microwaves often to reheat to-go boxes of Chipotle and Chinatown.</figcaption>

    <figure>
      <img src="./assets/richard.PNG" alt="Trulli" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
      <figcaption>Richard cooks at home and is familiar with his microwave back home, not with this microwave.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Manny represents how all users I interviewed are familiar with how to operate a microwave. Therefore, this persona is a character that experiences no issues when using a microwave.</p>
    <p>Richard represents some users that mentioned small differences between the microwave I saw them use and other microwaves they have used in the past. The microwave I chose has a few interesting features, such as a vent button for cooking (the microwave is above a gas stovetop). This persona is a character representing those who know how to use microwaves, but are new or unfamiliar with this specific microwave.</p>
